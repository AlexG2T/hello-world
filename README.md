Hey there demons... it's me, ya boi.

I only need to write a thesis to finish my master's degree but due to the pandemic it's been tough finding internships that could help with that processs.
Having that said, I've taken this as an opportunity to learn how to code at home by myself as it is a skill that I've always wanted to delve into.
When I applied for higher education I wanted to get into software engineering but my average score was too low for the entry requirement at the time...
I've started learning how to work with HTML and CSS about a month ago, and with PHP about 2 weeks ago.
I'll soon move on to learning Javascript in tandem with PHP so that I can know the basics of full stack development and start building my own engineering app.
